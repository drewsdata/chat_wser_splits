Hello and welcome to the Western States Endurance Run data set.  This data currently contains results from 2017 to 2024 excluding 2020 when the race was canclled due to Covid. *Data for aid stations "Dardanelles" (also known as "Cal-1") and "Ford's Bar" (also known as "Cal-3") is not included.* Ask questions and I can filter data, sort data, and provide answers about race data. For example:
<br>
<br>
Filtering and sorting:
* List all international runners without a DNF in order of finish time.<br>
* Filter the data to display the fastest 3 runners for each year who earned a bronze buckle.<br>

Questions:
* What percentage of runners did not finish the race each year?<br>
* If a runner made it to Foresthill between 14 and 15 hours, how likely were they to get a silver buckle?
* What was the average time difference between men and women in each year (indicate which gender is faster)?<br>

A black dot below or at the end of the last answer means I'm still responding. Remember, I am a large language model so experimentation, retries and patience are required.
