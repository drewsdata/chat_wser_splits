Hello and welcome to the Western States Endurance Run data set.  This data currently contains results from 2017 to 2024. Ask questions and I can filter data, sort data and provide race data answers. For example:
<br>
<br>
Filtering and sorting:
* Show all the runners from California.<br>
* List the runners in order of finish time.
* List the top 10 runners for each gender in each year in order of finish time.

Questions:
* What was the average age of the runners who got a silver buckle each year?<br>
* What percentage of runners did not finish the race each year?<br>
* What is the average time difference between men and women in each year (indicate which gender is faster)?
* Is there a noticeable finish time trend for runners age 40 or older who finish without a DNF?

A black dot below the last answer means I'm still preparing my final response. Remember, I am a large language model so some experimentation and patience is required. 
*Data for aid stations "Dardanelles" (also known as "Cal-1") and "Ford's Bar" (also known as "Cal-3") is not included.*
