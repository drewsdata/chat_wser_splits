Hello and welcome to the Western States Endurance Run data set.  This data currently contains results from 2017 to 2024. Ask questions and I can filter data, sort data and provide race data answers. For example:
<br>
<br>
Filtering and sorting:
* Show all the runners from California.<br>
* List the runners in order of finish time.
* List the top 10 runners for each gender in each year in order of finish times.

Questions:
* What was the average age of runners who got a silver buckle each year?<br>
* What percentage of runners did not finish the race each year?<br>
* What was the average pace in minutes per mile and minutes per kilometer from Foresthill to the finish for each gender?
* What was the average time difference between men and women in each year (indicate which gender is faster)?

A black dot below the last answer means I'm still responding. Remember, I am a large language model so some experimentation, retries and patience is required. 
*Data for aid stations "Dardanelles" (also known as "Cal-1") and "Ford's Bar" (also known as "Cal-3") is not included.*
