Hello and welcome to the Western States Endurance Run data set.  This data currently contains results from 2017 to 2024. Ask questions and I can filter data, sort data and provide race data answers. For example:
<br>
<br>
Filtering and sorting:<br>
* Show all the runners from California.<br>
* List the runners in order of finish time.
* List the top 10 runners for each gender in each year in order of finish time.
___
Questions:<br>
* What was the average age of the runners?<br>
* How many runners did not finish the race in 2023?<br>
* What is the mean average time difference between the men and women in each year (indicate which gender has the faster times)?
* Compare the mean average pace of women at least 50 years old to men at least 50 years old from the start to Foresthill who did not have a DNF finish.
* Is there a noticeable finish time trend for runners over 40 years old who finish the race without a DNF?
___
If you see a black dot below the last answer then I'm still preparing my final response. Remember, you are interacting with a large language model so some experimentation and patience is required while the model processes data. 
*The data does not contain checkpoint information for the aid stations "Dardanelles" (which is also known as "Cal-1") and "Ford's Bar" (which is also known as "Cal-3")*
