**Ask questions about the data, for example:**
<b></b>  

- **Filtering and sorting:**

    * <span class="suggestion">Show the fastest 3 runners for each year</span>
    * <span class="suggestion">List international runners (country other than USA) without a DNF ordered by finish time</span>  
<b></b>  

- **Answering questions:**

    * <span class="suggestion">What was the average age of runners who got a silver buckle each year?</span>
    * <span class="suggestion">If a runner made it to Foresthill between 14 and 15 hours, how likely were they to get a silver buckle?</span>
    * <span class="suggestion">What was the average time at Robinson Flat for runners who arrived at Foresthill between 17 and 18 hours and finished the race?</span>

**Notes:** Black dots below the question means I'm still processing data. I am a large language model so experimentation, retries and patience are required.
