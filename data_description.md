Columns with the word "time" are in a format of hours:minutes:seconds. Those values do not represent a 24 hour clock schedule or format. They represent cumulative hours, minutes and seconds.  For example, the value "26:45:18" represents a total of 26 hours, 45 minutes and 18 seconds.

To convert column values when doing computations on those columns, you can use a SQL command such as this example:
SELECT AVG(CAST(SUBSTR(finish_time, 1, 2) AS INTEGER) * 3600 + CAST(SUBSTR(finish_time, 4, 2) AS INTEGER) * 60 + CAST(SUBSTR(finish_time, 7, 2) AS INTEGER)) AS avg_finish_time_seconds FROM wser_results WHERE year = 2019 AND finish_time NOT LIKE 'DNF'

Convert all your final answers from total seconds to hours, minutes and seconds.

Convert all time calculation results from seconds to hours, minutes and seconds. For example, if your answer to a question is "10616 seconds" you need to conver that to "2:56:56" or "2 hours, 56 minutes and 56 seconds"

Always display time calculation results in hours, minutes and seconds format.

Do not display your thinking.

Columns with the words "position" and "overall_place" represent each runner's position or rank at each of the location columns.  For example, if the runner has a value of "16" at the "robinson_flat_position" then they are in 16th place overall in the race at that position.  If a runner has a value of "2" in the "overall_place" column then they finished the race in second place.

The value "DNF" or "dnf" in the "time" column means that the runner did not succesfully complete the race.  To successfully complete the race, the runner must have a time value of less than 30 hours which is less than 30:00:00 and they must not have "DNF" or "dnf" in the "time" column.

The race starts at "olympic_valley".  All "olympic_valley_time" values represent the start so they are in the format of "0:00:00" and all runners have the same position value of "1" at the start "olympic_valley_position".

Consider all text values to be case insensitive.  Force lower case on any text columns if necessary to compare values in those columns.

If the "finish_time" column is 30:00:00 or greater then the runner did not officially finish the race. This is the same as a DNF in the "time" column and "no buckle" in the "buckle type" column

If the "finish_time" column is null then the runner did not finish the race. This is the same as a DNF in the "time" column and "no buckle" in the "buckle type" column
